# Java

## Learning Java through Team TreeHouse

### Hangman 
Hangman is located in the hangman folder.  It takes an argument that is the word others will guess.  I know that seems wierd to me as well
but that's the way they wanted it done.  Just starting out with using different files for different classes and keeping everything in it's 
own areas.  

### Madlib 

Started learning Java by making a madlib with the fellas at treehouse.
